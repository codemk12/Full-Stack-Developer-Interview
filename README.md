# Vehicle Lead Capture – Take-Home

## Build Checklist
- **Dataset & Seeding** – Fetch the 50-lead JSON (`https://gist.githubusercontent.com/codemk12/3691a622ba446e4e39d0e80ece702a44/raw/leads.json`) and seed your database when empty.
- **Data Model** – Design a relational schema with multiple related tables (e.g., leads, sources, status history) that mirrors the dataset.
- **API Layer** – Build a CRUD microservice (list, create, update, delete) with proper validation, errors, and HTTP semantics.
- **UI Dashboard** – Deliver a lightweight UI that showcases every API action (listing, status change, delete, create).
- **Productivity Features** – Add search/filter/sort/pagination to keep the dashboard usable with 50+ leads.
- **Tooling & Setup** – Provide automated seed scripts plus clear setup/run instructions.
- **Polish (Optional)** – Tests, Docker packaging, deployment scripts, monitoring hooks, or anything else that demonstrates your craft.

## Submission
- **Timeline** – Please submit your solution within 48 hours.
- **Repository** – Push to a private GitHub repo and invite `codemk12`.
- **Handoff** – Include setup instructions (dependencies, env vars, migrations, seed commands) plus any known trade-offs.
